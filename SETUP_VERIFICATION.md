# GoHighLevel Integration Setup Verification

## ‚úÖ Code Changes Completed

### Backend (main.py)
- Added 3 new endpoints at line 4136:
  - `POST /api/ghl/create-subaccount`
  - `POST /api/ghl/create-user`
  - `POST /api/ghl/create-subaccount-and-user`
- Added request models for GHLSubAccountRequest and GHLUserCreationRequest
- Integrated with existing httpx import

### Frontend (ProgressiveSOLSetup.tsx)
- Modified `handleNotificationsComplete` function to:
  - Call the GHL API after setup completion
  - Show progress messages in chat
  - Handle success/error responses gracefully

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Backend Server Needs Restart

The backend server is currently running with the old code. To activate the new endpoints:

1. **Stop the current backend server:**
   ```bash
   # Find the process
   lsof -i :8000
   # Kill it (replace PID with actual process ID)
   kill -9 PID
   ```

2. **Start the backend with updated code:**
   ```bash
   cd /Users/somasekharaddakula/CascadeProjects/SquidgyBackend
   source venv/bin/activate  # If using virtual environment
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Verify endpoints are available:**
   ```bash
   python test_ghl_simple.py
   ```

4. **Test the full integration:**
   ```bash
   python test_ghl_endpoints.py
   ```

## üß™ Testing the Complete Flow

### Backend Testing
Run `test_ghl_endpoints.py` to verify:
- Individual endpoint functionality
- Combined endpoint that creates both subaccount and user
- Proper error handling

### Frontend Testing
1. Start a new chat session with SOL Agent
2. Complete all three setup steps:
   - Solar Setup
   - Calendar Setup  
   - Notification Setup
3. After completion, you should see:
   - "Creating your GoHighLevel account..." message
   - Success message with account details
   - Or error message if something fails (without breaking the chat)

## üìã Important Notes

- The current implementation uses hardcoded tokens and IDs
- In production, these should be environment variables
- The user created is always "Ovi Colton" with role "user" (not admin)
- All solar workflows are loaded via the snapshot ID
