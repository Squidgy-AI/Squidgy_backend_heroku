# GoHighLevel Integration Summary

## Overview
This integration automatically creates GoHighLevel sub-accounts and users after completing the Solar Sales Specialist setup in the Squidgy frontend.

## Backend Endpoints Created

### 1. Create Sub-account
**Endpoint:** `POST /api/ghl/create-subaccount`
- Creates a new GoHighLevel sub-account with the solar snapshot
- Returns the location_id for the created sub-account

### 2. Create User  
**Endpoint:** `POST /api/ghl/create-user`
- Creates an OVI user (not admin) for the specified location
- Assigns full permissions to the user

### 3. Combined Creation
**Endpoint:** `POST /api/ghl/create-subaccount-and-user`
- Creates both sub-account and user in one call
- This is the endpoint called by the frontend

## Frontend Integration

The integration is triggered in `ProgressiveSOLSetup.tsx` after all three setup steps are complete:
1. Solar Setup ✅
2. Calendar Setup ✅  
3. Notification Setup ✅

After the notification setup completion message, the system:
1. Shows "Creating your GoHighLevel account..." message
2. Calls the combined endpoint to create both sub-account and user
3. Displays success message with account details
4. Handles errors gracefully without disrupting the user experience

## Important Notes

- The agency token and IDs are currently hardcoded - these should be moved to environment variables in production
- The user created is always "Ovi Colton" with role "user" (not admin)
- All solar workflows, pipelines, and automations are loaded via the snapshot
- Error handling ensures the chat experience continues even if GHL creation fails
